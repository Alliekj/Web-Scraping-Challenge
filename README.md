# Web Scraping Challenge

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on the analysis of Mars-related data using Python. It includes scraping Mars news, analyzing Mars weather data, and calculating various metrics like temperature trends and atmospheric pressure on Mars.

**Contents**:
1. part_1_mars_news.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook is responsible for scraping the latest Mars news articles. The data extracted includes article titles and previews, which are then used for further analysis.

2. part_2_mars_weather.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook focuses on the analysis of Mars weather data. It processes the data stored in the mars_temperature_data.csv file and includes visualizations like temperature trends and atmospheric pressure over time.

3. Resources/mars_temperature_data.csv: This CSV file contains temperature and pressure data recorded on Mars. It is used in the part_2_mars_weather.ipynb notebook to perform the analysis.

**Installation and Setup**

Prerequisites:
To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed on your local machine:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Git
**Necessary Python libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, splinter, bs4

**Setup**:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and Open part_1_mars_news.ipynb and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb in your browser to execute the code.

**Usage**:
1. Run part_1_mars_news.ipynb to scrape the latest Mars news articles from a specified website.
2. Run part_2_mars_weather.ipynb to analyze Mars weather data, including temperature trends and atmospheric pressure. This notebook also estimates the length of a Martian year in Earth days.
